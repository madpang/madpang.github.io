=== Ticket 1

@brief:
Figure out a folder structure for the project, such that both local test using `file://` and deployment on a server are possible

@status: TODO

@date:
- created on 2025-02-26
- updated on 2025-02-26

@details:
The current folder has the following structure:
+++ tree
.
|- README.txt
|- tickets.txt  # issue tracker, progress log
|- index.html   # the entry point of the website
|- common/      # top level assets
|  |- fonts/
|  |- images/
|  |- styles/
|  |  |- style.css
|  |  |- common -> ../../common   # THE CRUX OF THE MATTER
|  |- scripts/

It makes local testing easy, referencing the resources with relative paths.
But when deployed to GitHub Pages, the symbolic link causes problems---since it forms a loop to the top level---GitHub Actions is stuck in an infinite recursion when trying to archive artifacts, spitting the following error:

  ./index.html

If, instead, using absolute path for the resources, the local testing will break, since the browser will not be able to find the resources.

The purpose of this ticket is to find a way to have both local testing and deployment possible, with minimal setup.

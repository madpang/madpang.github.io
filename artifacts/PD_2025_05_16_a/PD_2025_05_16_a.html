<h1>Building a blog website</h1>
<pre>

=== TL;DR

Build a blog website, with "bare hands"---no WordPress-like content management system, no static site generator.
Write content in plain text, do custom conversion to HTML, deploy to GitHub Pages with self-defined workflow.
Everything is done in a simple, straightforward and transparent way.

=== Method

1. The folder organization
2. The markup converter
3. The deployment flow

--- Folder Structure

+++ tree
madpang.github.io
|- contents
|  |- a-single-post
|  |  |- post-text.txt
|  |  |- media/
|- artifacts
|  |- a-single-post
|  |  |- post-text.html
|  |  |- media/
|- index.html
+++
The `artifacts/a-single-post` folder is the output of the conversion process.

--- Post Generation

+++ cmd
./build-post.ps1 ./artifacts/PD_2025_05_16_a/PD_2025_05_16_a.html ./contents/PD_2025_05_16_a/PD_2025_05_16_a.txt ./commons/templates/post-template.html

=== Background

I want maximal control on page design, content organization, and deployment process, so I do not want to rely on any easy-to-use but actually overly complicated templates from CMS provider or static site generator.
For example, I have used Jekyll and Hugo, but I have to obey their rules on how to organize contents, which I find uncomfortable.

I even find the Markdown format somewhat restrictive---I would like to bend it a little bit to suit my needs.
So I implement my own converter.

To the core, I desire maximal freedom on creation.
